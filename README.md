## Project Information
The source is supposed to be available in the release files; however, I do not have a Mac and have not been able to extract it.
If you are able to extract the source files, please create an issue and attach the files in a zip or other format.

This project also relies on the Legoâ€™s SDK for USB IR tower communication
